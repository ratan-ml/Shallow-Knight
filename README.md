Background:
Welcome to the "Shallow-Knight" project! This 2D game draws inspiration from the beloved indie game "Hollow Knight." While my game won't match the complexity and depth of the original, it aims to capture the essence of Hollow Knight's combat system. As the player, you'll venture through three levels, engaging in intense battles with formidable bosses. You'll have a limited number of lives to test your skills and defeat these tough adversaries.

**Player Character Controls:**
   - Responsive and intuitive controls for movement, jumping, and attacking, mirroring the fluidity of Hollow Knight's gameplay.

**Boss Battles:**
   - Face off against three unique bosses, each with its own set of attack patterns and phases, designed to test your combat skills.

**Health and Lives System:**
   - Manage your character's health, and be prepared for a challenging experience where you'll have 3 lives to conquer the bosses.

**Speedrun Timer:**
   - A built-in timer stopwatch to keep track of the time taken to defeat each boss for speedrun purposes.

**Basic Art and Graphics:**
   - While not as detailed as the original, you can expect simple 2D art and animations for characters, bosses, and the game world.

**Minimal Sound and Music:**
   - Enjoy a basic soundtrack and essential sound effects to enhance your gameplay.
