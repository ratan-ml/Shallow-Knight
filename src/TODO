fix attack
-FIXED when performing jump, attack box appearance is not consistent
    - mainly when leftfacing
- attacking the boss once only reads one collision

fix jump
- there is lag/buffer when jump and be performed again
    - may keep unlimited jumps, but must ensure player is inbound

work on boss class
- queue/chain attack patterns (cycle)
    - cooldown between attack pattern transitions

work on projectiles
- will this class house multiple variations of projectile?
    - column
    - horizontal rectangle
    - bullets
- get bullets to shoot from boss.pos
    - it is being created but not shot out, prob proj class bug
    - in "x" interval

decrement hp
- when attack box collides with boss, decrement boss hp
- when player collides with projectile or boss, decrement player hp

next boss (don't get ahead of yourself buddy)
